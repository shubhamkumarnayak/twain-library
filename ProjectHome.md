2 years ago when we started to develop a product for electronic document management system, I started to search for a suitable library through which we can talk to any TWAIN compatible scanner with ADF/ Flatbed feature in production environment but every successful match came with a cost. So I started to develop a .Net wrapper of TWAIN. I have tested it with the following scanner,
a.	Kodak
b.	HP
c.	Fujitsu
